<h1 align="center">Lumiere</h1>

**Lumiere** is a next-generation, production-ready path tracer engine that allows artists and developers to render scenes in 3D. Through the use of the Vulkan API, Lumiere (current roadmap) offers features unseen by other path tracing systems such as:

- **Light Transport Framework** that is pysically accurate through
  - consistency with the physical properties of both light and materials,
  - consistency with Maxwell's electromagnetic theory,
  - consistency with general relativity.
- Implementations of **various paradigms** (e.g. Blinn-Phong, MCMC-based methods, etc) through different render paradigms such as
  - Classic Ray Tracing (= *MCRT*)
  - Ray Marching (= *Sphere Tracing* and/or *Segment Tracing*)
- **Integration** with other 3D creation tools such as Blender or Cinema4D.

### Building

A Visual Studio solution can be generated by following the following steps:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/PolyRocketMatt/Lumiere.git
cd .\Lumiere\Scripts
.\Setup-Windows.bat
```

Currently, Lumiere is **only supported on Windows**. Support for Linux/MacOS will be added in the future.
